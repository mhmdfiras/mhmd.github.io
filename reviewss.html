        <p>"I had a disappointing experience at Jewel Hospital. The wait times were excessively long, and the staff seemed overwhelmed and disorganized.

        <h3>Mixed Review:</h3> 
        <p>"My time at Jewel Hospital was a mixed bag. While some aspects of my care were excellent, such as the expertise of the medical team and the efficiency of certain departments, there were also notable shortcomings. Communication between staff and patients could be improved, and the facilities felt somewhat cramped and lacking in amenities. Ultimately, my opinion is somewhat divided, but I would consider returning for certain services."</p>
